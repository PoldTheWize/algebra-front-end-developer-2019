        <h1>1. Markup languages</h1>

        <p>A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. 
            Markup languages are used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable
             from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text.</p>
             
        <dl>
            <dt>Types of markup languages</dt>
            <dd>- Presentational markup - used by traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary codes embedded within document text (e.g. Microsoft Word).</dd>
            <dd>- Procedural markup - markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions for programs to process the text (e.g. TeX).</dd>
            <dd>- Descriptive (logical) markup - markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed (e.g. HTML).</dd>

        <h1>1.2. HTML</h1>

        <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</p>
        <p>HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.</p>

        <h1>1.2.1. How the browser displays HTML</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM tree.</li>
            <li>The DOM tree is used to construct a render tree.</li>
            <li>A layout is generated from the render tree.</li>
            <li>The render three is painted to the screen according to the generated layout.</li>
        </ul>
